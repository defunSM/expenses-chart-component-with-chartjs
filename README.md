## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

I learned how to use the chart.js library to create interactive graphs. It was much simpler than I taught to just make a barchart. Other things I learned was the importance of using media queries to make the site mobile responsive.

### Continued development

There is always more room to make the charts more dynamic possibly by using nextjs can do a fetch and source expenses from an API endpoint.
